Hi, I'm Abhinav rawat

ðŸŒ± I'm currently studying for my CCNA
ðŸ“« How to reach me rawatabhi04@proton.me I'm currently preparing for my CCNA 200-301 Exam. During this preparation, I build some labs on various topics of Networking with the help of Cisco Packet Tracer


Campus Network:
This project includes various networking protocols that replicates a real world scenario. 

This lab has a core layer of two Cisco 3650 layer 3 switches, three layer 2 swithces distribution layer and PCs as access layer.

Assigned switches interface into proper vlans. Set the VTP domain to CCNA and for security assigned enable password and VTY password of cisco

Optimized spanning tree with Core1 being root for odd VLANs and Core2 the root for even VLANS. This allows us to use interfaces which would otherwise be blocking the traffic.

Configured LACP between core switches.

Configured intervlan routing between core switches andlayer 2 switches.


Configured HSRP to provide reduendency for the network in case on of the Core switche falis.

Configred OSPF to provide connectivity between core switches and ISP router
